## 1. Introduction

This project aims to create a visual effect for a gun effect inspired by the *Borderlands* series using Unity 3D. *Borderlands* is renowned for its shaded graphics and over-the-top comic-like effects, particularly in its weaponry. The focus will be on the gun’s visual effects, particularly the bullet effects, which will include muzzle flashes, bullet trails, and impact animations. This proposal outlines the idea for the unique gun effect that hopefully captures the essence of these visual effects while exploring 3D graphics.

## 2. Tools

For this project, Unity 3D will serve as the foundation for creating gun effects. The **VFX Graph** will be the primary tool used to develop particle systems for the muzzle flash, bullet trails, and impact effects. Additionally, **Shader Graph** will be used to give these particles a distinctive cel-shaded look, inspired by the *Borderlands* games. **Post-processing effects**, such as bloom and motion blur, will be added using Unity’s Post-Processing Stack, ensuring the final visuals are polished and cohesive.

Additional software includes:
- **Blender** for 3D particle design.
- **Adobe Photoshop** for UV mapping and texturing.

## 3. Design Approach

### a. Projectile/Bullet  
We will present a light flash effect on the tip of the gun when a shot is fired, providing instant visual feedback to the player.

### b. Muzzle Flash  
The bullet will be visually modeled and will be seen sliding out of the weapon, giving a real feel to the shooting action.

### c. Impacts  
Bullets fired at objects such as iron will produce a splash effect to add a realistic impression.

### d. Flamethrower (Optional)  
We will simulate a continuous stream of fire effect projected from the weapon's nozzle.
